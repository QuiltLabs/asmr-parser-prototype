# ASMR Parser Prototype
An experimental ASMR intermediate format parser prototype. This will be used to experiment with an "intermediate" ASMR patch format and to discover its limitations and capabilities.

# [What is ASMR?](https://github.com/QuiltMC/asmr-processor-prototype#what-is-asmr)
ASMR (ASM-Regex) is the temporary name for a project eventually (maybe, hopefully) intended to replace Mixin.

Ideas for ASMR were first discussed publicly [in this Fabric issue](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader/issues/244). The overall idea (having a backend, frontend, compiler and processor) has not changed since then, however specific details have been fleshed out since.

Details of the current design will be published in due course.
